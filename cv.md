### About myself:

My goal is a confident front-end with deep knowledge of JS and web-development.

Strong skills based on work experience: confident knowledge of a computer device; high skills of self-study and quick problem solving (hardware sphere, freelance); high sociability and involvement in teamwork, constant communication with people (a bright period of work as a bartender).

I'm currently studying intensively and am trying very hard to become a frontend specialist. I really enjoy it! With each step, there is more and more motivation.
